This repository contains the R scripts necessary to run a shiny application that I built to explore the Lahman baseball data set (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/).  The documentation for the app is below:

"This shiny application performs data visualization and some basic exploratory data analysis of the Lahman baseball data set in R (http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/). This first option from the dropdown menu on the left displays the documentation for the application. The second option plots a user chosen baseball statistic (e.g., strikeouts per game, homeruns per game, etc.) as a function of the year using rPlot from rcharts. The third option displays scatterplots of two user chosen statistics in order to visually discern if interactions exist. The user can also choose to group the data in certain ways as well as add regression lines to the plot. This application is based off and inspired by the NYT Interactive Graphic tutorial from the rCharts gallery (http://rcharts.io/nytinteractive/)."

The app can be viewed on shinyapps.io via the following link:
